shortdescription: We implemented a new neuroimaging analysis toolbox for modeling linear and nonlinear effects overcoming the limitations of the standard neuroimaging processing tools that perform statistical inference based only on linear models. NeAT is a modular,  exible and user-friendly tool via command line interface that provides a range of statistical and machine learning non-linear methods for model estimation. Several metrics based on curve fitting and complexity are used for model inference. The toolbox includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for visualization of results.

## Description

We implemented a new neuroimaging analysis toolbox for modeling linear and nonlinear effects overcoming the limitations of the standard neuroimaging processing tools that perform statistical inference based only on linear models. NeAT is a modular,  exible and user-friendly tool via command line interface that provides a range of statistical and machine learning non-linear methods for model estimation. Several metrics based on curve fitting and complexity are used for model inference. The toolbox includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for visualization of results.
