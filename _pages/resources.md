## Web application
<b>[NextBrain interactive tool.](https://github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/NextBrain/#/home) </b><br/>
Authors: James Hughes, <b>Adrià Casamitjana</b>, Peter Schmidt, Juan Eugenio Iglesias <br/>

We present a next-generation probabilistic atlas of the human brain using histological sections of five full human hemispheres with manual annotations for 333 regions of interest. This website enables the interactive inspection of these five cases using a  3D navigation interface  and search functionality.

## Software
<b>[NextBrain segmentation tool](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/HistoAtlasSegmentation) </b><br/>
Main authors: Oula, Puonti, Juan Eugenio Iglesias; Collaborators: <b>Adrià Casamitjana</b> <br/>

I collaborated in the implementation of the NextBrain segmentation toolWe implemented a new neuroimaging analysis toolbox for modeling linear and nonlinear effects overcoming the limitations of the standard neuroimaging processing tools that perform statistical inference based only on linear models. NeAT is a modular,  exible and user-friendly tool via command line interface that provides a range of statistical and machine learning non-linear methods for model estimation. Several metrics based on curve fitting and complexity are used for model inference. The toolbox includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for visualization of results.
