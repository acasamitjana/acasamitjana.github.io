<b>[NeAT: A nonlinear neuroimaging analysis toolbox.](https://acasamitjana.github.io/personal-webpage-jekyll/resources/software-NeAT)<br/>
Authors: <b>Adrià Casamitjana</b>, Santi Puch, Asier Aduriz, Verónica Vilaplana, Juando Gispert, José Luis Molinuevo<br/>
<p>We implemented a new neuroimaging analysis toolbox for modeling linear and nonlinear effects overcoming the limitations of the standard neuroimaging processing tools that perform statistical inference based only on linear models. NeAT is a modular,  exible and user-friendly tool via command line interface that provides a range of statistical and machine learning non-linear methods for model estimation. Several metrics based on curve fitting and complexity are used for model inference. The toolbox includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for visualization of results.</p>
