* I am a Ph.D. student in the [Image Processing Group (GPI)](https://imatge.upc.edu/) at [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/), under the supervision of Dr. [Verónica Vilaplana](https://imatge.upc.edu/web/people/veronica-vilaplana). <br/>

* My main research intests include brain MRI segmentation, statistical learning for multimodal data and bayesian modeling. Over the course of my PhD I have been developing modeling tools to study Alzheimer's diesease (AD) using MRI, with special focus in early AD stages and its application to clinical trials.
* During my PhD I have collaborated with the BarcelonaBeta Brain Research Centre (BBRC) and I visited the Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC) at University College of London working with Dr. Andre Altman.
