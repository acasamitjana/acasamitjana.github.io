* I am a post-doc researcher in the [ViCOROB](https://www.bcn-aim.org/) research institute from Universitat de Girona (UdG) working on medical image analysis, mainly involved in brain modelling. My main interests are on using multimodal and longitudinal models to study normal aging and disease progression, merging different image modalities with non-imaging data.

* Previously, I was a visiting researcher at [BIG](https://www.ub.edu/portal/web/dp-biomedicalsciences/group-sala) (2023), [BCN-AIM](https://www.bcn-aim.org/) (2022) groups from UB and a post-doc researcher at [Center for Medical Image Computing (CMIC)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-image-computing/) from [University College of London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) (2019-2022), working with Dr. [Juan Eugenio Iglesias](https://sites.google.com/site/jeiglesias/) in developing next generation image analysis tools. I pursued my PhD in the [Image Processing Group (GPI)](https://imatge.upc.edu/) at [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/) under the supervision of Dr. [Verónica Vilaplana](https://imatge.upc.edu/web/people/veronica-vilaplana). We collaborated with the BarcelonaBeta Brain Research Centre ([BBRC](https://www.barcelonabeta.org/)) on developing models of early stages of AD using machine learning and MRI and its application to clinical trials.

# Recent News
------
* June 2025. New paper alert! [USLR: An open-source tool for unbiased and smooth longitudinal registration of brain MRI](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841525002099) is now available in Medical Image Analysis. If you are interested in longitudinal trajectories of brain biomarkers, check it out!
* October 2024. Part of the organizing committe of the SASHIMI workshop in Marrakesh. It was great to see many great publications on brain image synthesis and simulation.
* May 2024. Attended to ISBI congress in Athens, where I presented two works: (1) Multimodal brain registration, involving structural and functional MRI and PET; (2) MRI-DaTSCAN registration and its implications to Parkinson's disease.
* January 2024. New position as a post-doc researcher at ViCOROB institute in my hometown, Girona. Really looking forward to it!
* March, 2023. Visiting researcher at BIG laboratory within the Biophysics department of Universitat de Barcelona. Willing to work with Dr. Roser Sala-Llonch on multimodal image processing methods.
* September, 2022. New manuscript online! Our paper <b>"High-resolution atlasing and segmentation of the subcortex: review and perspective on challenges and opportunities created by machine learning"</b> has been accepted in Neuroimage (Special Issue: Terra incognita: diving into the human subcortex). We review the literature on subcortical atlases and segmentation methods and discuss challenges and opportunities of using machine learning for in vivo segmentation of MRI. Hope you enjoy!
