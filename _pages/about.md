* I am a post-doc in [Center for Medical Image Computing (CMIC)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-image-computing/) at [University College of London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), working with Dr. [Juan Eugenio Iglesias](https://sites.google.com/site/jeiglesias/) in developing next generation tools for neuroimage analysis. <br/>

* My main research intests include brain MRI segmentation, statistical learning for multimodal data and bayesian modeling. Over the course of my PhD I have been developing modeling tools to study Alzheimer's diesease (AD) using MRI, with special focus in early AD stages and its application to clinical trials.
* I did my PhD on the study of early stages of AD using machine learning and MRI and its application to clinical trials. I worked under the supervision of Dr. [Verónica Vilaplana](https://imatge.upc.edu/web/people/veronica-vilaplana) in the [Image Processing Group (GPI)](https://imatge.upc.edu/) at [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/). During my PhD, I collaborated with the BarcelonaBeta Brain Research Centre (BBRC) and I visited the Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC) at University College of London working with Dr. Andre Altman.
