## Abstract
Nonlinear inter-modality registration is often challenging due
to the lack of objective functions that are good proxies for alignment.
Here we propose a synthesis-by-registration method to convert this prob-
lem into an easier intra-modality task. We introduce a registration loss
for weakly supervised image translation between domains that does not
require perfectly aligned training data. This loss capitalises on a regis-
tration U-Net with frozen weights, to drive a synthesis CNN towards the
desired translation. We complement this loss with a structure preserv-
ing constraint based on contrastive learning, which prevents blurring and
content shifts due to overfitting. We apply this method to the registration
of histological sections to MRI slices, a key step in 3D histology recon-
struction. Results on two public datasets show improvements over regis-
tration based on mutual information (13% reduction in landmark error)
and synthesis-based algorithms such as CycleGAN (11% reduction), and
are comparable to registration with label supervision. Code and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/acasamitjana/SynthByReg.
