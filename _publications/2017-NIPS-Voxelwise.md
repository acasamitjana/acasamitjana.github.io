## Abstract
This paper describes a new neuroimaging analysis toolbox that allows for the modeling of nonlinear effects at the voxel level, overcoming limitations of methods based on linear models like the GLM. We illustrate its features using a relevant example in which distinct nonlinear trajectories of Alzheimer’s disease related brain atrophy patterns were found across the full biological spectrum of the disease. The open-source toolbox is available in GitHub: https://github.com/imatge-upc/VNeAT.
